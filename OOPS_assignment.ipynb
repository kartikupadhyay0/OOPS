    "\n",
    "Ans:The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows developers to interact with objects at a high level without needing to understand the specifics of how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they are actually instances of a child class. This enables methods to perform differently based on the object that is calling them, enhancing flexibility and integration in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), defining attributes and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class that contains actual values and can perform actions defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts work together to create a modular and organized approach to programming.\n",
